> * The store version and the side-loaded version are updated synchronously

### Application brief introduction

The Microsoft Store provides a distribution, download, and update channel for apps that are already on the shelves. But in the latest Microsoft Store, Microsoft requires users to use an online account to download apps from the store. This has plagued some users who never use a Microsoft account and whose apps must rely on store downloads. The app uses the acquisition interface provided by Microsoft Store, bypassing the official App Download Channel provided by the Microsoft Store. Users can download the required app installation packages offline for standalone deployment.

------

### The basic functionality of the app

> * Bypass the Microsoft Store to download and deploy Microsoft Store apps offline
> * Search the store app
> * Check the version status of store apps and update older apps
> * Device application Management
> * Visit the web version (in case of interface problems) and download using the app's built-in download tool
> * WinGet package installation, uninstall and upgrade

Note: The app can't bypass the Microsoft Store's billing channels, and if the app you're getting is a paid app, download it after purchasing it from the Microsoft Store.

### Download and installation considerations

> * The program is built using the Windows Apps SDK, and it is recommended that your system version be Windows 11 (codename 21H2 / build 22000) or later, and the minimum version is Windows 11 (codename 21H2 / build 22000) or later.
> * If your system is Windows 10, there are some limitations to app functionality:
    Setting the mica/mica alt background color is not supported
> * [Release](https://github.com/Gaoyifei1011/GetStoreApp/releases) The binary installation file for the page has been packaged into a compressed package. Unzip the package and run the install.ps1 file in Powershell admin mode (if necessary) for a quick installation.
> * Download and compile the project source code yourself. (Please read the project compilation steps below carefully)

------

### Project compilation steps and app localization

#### <p align="center">Tools that must be installed</p>

> * [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) 
> * . NET Desktop Development (Installed in Visual Studio Installer, .NET SDK Version 9.0)
> * [WinGet package manager](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9NBLGGH4NNS1) (install recommendedly)
> * [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/zh-cn/microsoft-edge/webview2) (install recommendedly)

#### <p align="center">Compilation steps</p>

> * Fork the project and download the code locally
> * Use Visual Studio 2022 to open the GetStoreApp.sln file. If the solution prompts that some tools are not installed, complete the installation steps and open the solution again.
> * Restore the Nuget package for the project.
> * After the restore is complete, right-click the project solution, generate the solution and click Deploy Solution.
> * Open the Start menu after the deployment is complete to run the app.

#### <p align="center">App localization</p>
##### The project was initially available in both Chinese Simplified and English formats, and if you want to translate your app into a language you are familiar with or correct errors in content that has been translated, please refer to the steps below.

> * Look for readme template files in the DeScription folder, for example, the English version is a README_EN-US.md file, rename it to README_(corresponding language).md file.
> * Open the renamed file, translate all the statements and save them. Please check it carefully after the translation is completed.
> * Open the README.md of the project's home page and add your language in the language selection at the top. For example, "English", note that the text is accompanied by a hyperlink.
> * README_ (corresponding language).The language screenshot added in the md file is replaced with the app screenshot in the language you are familiar with.
> * Complete the translation steps described above to ensure that all steps run smoothly.
> * Open the GetStoreAppPackage packaging project, find the Package.appxmanifest file, right-click the file, click View Code, find the Sources tab, and add the corresponding language according to the template, such as "<Resource Language="EN-US"/>".
> * Open the Strings folder of the GetStoreApp project and create the language you are using, for example ( English (United States) folder name is en-us , you can refer to the Table of Indicating Language (Culture) Codes and Countries and Regions)
> * Open the resjson file under the subfolder and translate each name.
> * Compile and run the code and test your language, when the application is first opened if there is no language you use to display English (United States) by default, it needs to be dynamically adjusted in the settings.
> * Create a PR after completing the above steps, then submit the modified content to this project and wait for the merge.
